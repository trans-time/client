  find friends and collaborators in a community of trans+ people.

  post art, selfies, and words, then create dynamic 360Â° timelines using #tags and *identities.

  let the whole world follow you, but share private posts with just your friends.

  spread your timelines on other social media platforms like twitter and facebook.

  trans time is not a startup. we will not sell your data, advertise to you, or profit off your content. we are volunteer-run and committed to keeping capital out of our app . . . though donations are always welcome to help us cover our expenses.
