  goal:
    title: "Our Goal"
    1: "Our goal is simple: maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone."
    2: "Safe doesn’t mean conflict free. It means handling conflict in a way that is respectful, collaborative, and educational. Safety means you can make mistakes and still be treated with respect, as long as you’re earnest in your desire to do - and be - better moving forward."
    3: "We mean EVERYONE - regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic."
  guidelines:
    title: "Guidelines"
    1: "The guidelines are simple too: respect each other, and don’t be a jerk."
    respect:
      1: "Respect: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we can’t allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one."
      2: "In the interest of respecting all members’ personal boundaries, we do ask that you use tags as content warnings. This particularly applies to NSFW and/or potentially triggering content. As we do have some members who are under the age of 18 and therefore cannot view content or participate in discussions that are ‘adult’ or otherwise inappropriate in nature, we absolutely require that you label this content NSFW. On the flip side, if you're under 18, we cannot allow you to post or view NSFW content."
    disrespect:
      title: "Disrespect (“Jerk Behavior”):"
      1: "Words or actions that might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature."
      2: "Don’t use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms."
      3: "Don’t show disrespect towards others. (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.)"
      4: "Intimidation or harassment."
      5: "Disrespect towards differences of opinion."
      6: "Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop. If they stop responding/disengage, stop."
      7: "Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement."
      8: "Sustained disruptions."
      9: "Violence, threats of violence or violent language."
  yourDiscomfort:
    title: "What to Do When You’re Uncomfortable"
    1: "If you feel like someone’s violating the code, whether to you or anyone else, there are a few courses of action available depending on your comfort level:"
    2: "DO: If you feel comfortable, politely speak up to the person. Here are some example ways:"
    3: "Hey - think we’re toeing the line here with the code of conduct, can you dial it back a bit?"
    4: "Hi! When you said [thing], I felt really uncomfortable. Could you please avoid using [phrase] in the future?"
    5: "Could you label content like this with [content warning], please?"
    6: "DO: If you aren’t comfortable speaking up, flag the item for our mods and express your concerns. Mods will do their best to help!"
    7: "DON’T: Insult or make the issue about the person. Instead, focus on the actions or words that made you upset"
    8: "DON’T: Take the conflict to other social media spaces. Backchanneling, sub-texting, and vaguing all enhance drama, not address it, and you should never call out someone by name outside `trans time` without their consent."
  othersDiscomfort:
    title: "What to Do When You Make Someone Uncomfortable"
    1: "If someone comes to you saying they’re uncomfortable, you ALSO have a few courses of action depending on your comfort level:"
    2: "DO: Apologize for hurting someone. This isn’t about whether you think their feelings are valid, or if they’re overreacting. The fact is, you made someone uncomfortable - and you probably didn’t mean to! Apologizing when you’ve just been confronted can be hard, but it’s a great way to show good intent."
    3: "DO: Ask for clarification if needed, but be aware that no one is required to educate you or continue to engage with you if it’s beyond their comfort level. Be careful in your phrasing! This is about clarification, not justification. No one needs to justify their discomfort to you."
    4: "DO: Try to understand the situation and figure out how you can be more awesome in the future."
    5: "DO: Take a break for a little bit to cool off. Taking space for yourself and your thoughts can help de-escalate biological emotional responses and provide clarifying distance."
    6: "DO: If you truly feel you’re free of error, flag the conversation for additional information/discussion."
    7: "DON’T: Attack the person who confronted you, or make the conflict personal."
    8: "DON’T: Continue to engage with the person if they choose to disengage."
    9: "DON’T: Take the conflict to other social media spaces. Backchanneling, sub-texting, and vaguing all enhance drama, not address it, and you should never call out someone by name outside the server without their consent."
  enforcement:
    title: "Enforcement"
    1: "Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior affects everyone."
    2: "Every situation is different depending on context, circumstance, and severity. Mods will use their discretion about how to handle a particular conflict, but the normal escalation goes like this:"
    3: "Inform a member that their behavior was problematic and discuss if necessary."
    4: "If the problem continues, members will receive a formal warning from a mod."
    5: "If the conflict continues without improvement after the formal warning, expulsion will be used as a last resort. This sucks for EVERYONE - don’t make us do it!"
    6: "Extreme violations (eg: threats of violence and trolling) will lead to immediate expulsion."
