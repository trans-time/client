  followUpHeader: "purpose"
  followUp1: "when we transition, we're often transitioning in <strong>many ways</strong> at once: our relationships, our affect, our art, our bodies—and countless other less tangible changes too."
  followUp2: "by documenting and sharing our stories, we hope to further develop a <strong>collective understanding</strong> of how transitioning reshapes our lives."
  followUp3: "this self-knowledge is essential in a time when <strong>medical</strong> and <strong>political</strong> communities don't understand us, and yet are trying to define, mobilize, and profit off of us."
  features:
    content: "document, share, and discuss your transition in a <strong>proactively moderated</strong> community"
    connections: "find trans+ people with similiar <strong>*identities</strong>, including religion, race, sexuality, and gender"
    timelines: "view somebody's whole timeline, or filter it by <strong>#tag</strong>, as with: #face, #chest, #family, #fashion, or #art"
    privacy: "control who sees your content with <strong>private/public posts</strong>"
  note: "<em>trans time</em> will never sell your data. we are <strong>volunteer-run</strong> and committed to creating a safe and non-exploitative space on the web."
