  lead: "we are an online community for <strong>trans</strong>, <strong>questioning</strong>, and <strong>gender nonconforming</strong> people."
  polytemporal: "we believe that transitioning is more than a single linear process. it's a <strong>tangle of many changes</strong>: perhaps to our bodies, our relationships, or our understanding of the world."
  tool: "as a tool, <strong>trans time</strong> helps us tease apart and explore our experiences as trans ppl. as a community, we're here to compare notes, find people we can relate to, and help each other lead our best lives."
  whatWeDo: "we're formalizing the concept of the 'trans timeline,' creating a safe space where we can share photos and discuss the impact transitioning is having on our lives."
  gettingStarted: "if you'd like a quick tutorial on how to use the app, <a href='https://www.transtime.is/users/celeste/timeline?tags=%5B\"welcome\"%5D'>celeste</a> would be happy to help out! ^__^"
  features:
    content: "don't worry too much about trolls; trans time <strong>proactively moderates</strong> to keep this space as safe as possible"
    freedom: "post whatever you like; <strong>we don't censor content</strong>, not even porn, images of self-harm, or discussions about sex work"
    contentWarnings: "easily filter <strong>triggering content</strong>; anything that's tagged can be hidden from your feed"
  note: "we're trans-led and volunteer-run. we'll never advertise to you or sell your data, and we're committed to creating something transformative, beautiful, and weird; let's see what we can grow in this little corner of the web. <3 <3 <3"
